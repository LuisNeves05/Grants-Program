- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

The future of blockchain is in the multichain capabillities a single blockchain has. 
As so, NEFTME is looking for a partner with the capacity to help us grow and sustain the immense user load we plan on bringing in. 
We imagine our app's feed looking like an aggregation of NFT's from multiple chains. And thats where we think Polkadot comes in!

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

I'm always thinking about business and business strategies to succeed and test new disruptive ideas for the market. I always want to shorten the flows of any process or create things that have never been seen, creating a need for the market.

On the other hand (and speaking of perseverance), NEFTME is a
perfect example where with only 25k$, we managed to create our MVP (without big
support and financing, with the market in total bear market) and we are heading
in the right direction. , even without great resources but always focused on
success. We are currently in alpha 4 version, which makes us the right example of believing and fighting for success

Basically I believe that NEFTME compiles 3 different worlds:
very strong people in the tech area (both in web2 and web3), very competent
people in the area of operations, continuous improvement and optimization of
processes and people with a very large network of contacts ( at the level of
global personalities) that will make a difference in terms of the go to market
strategy and the traction of the dApp at the end point.


### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

https://www.notion.so/neftme/NEFTME-App-29acb1ae6d034a0b9d07a46ee7e5b04a

NEFTME is a system composed by 2 main components. Using a REST API for the backend in Ruby on Rails and React Native with Javascript for the frontend. 

The backend is currently hosted on Heroku and the frontend uses Expo GO to host the app.

Currently, we are EVM based (smart contracts). However, this technical constraint was due to a time urgency and is not final. We simply wanted to deploy our dApp and show the world what we can do!

We will now show diagrams detailing our integration.

Physical View

We currently use amazon AWS to store the NFT images, but we intend to change to IPFS when we go live on mainnet!
In fact, our goal is to be 100% decentralized on all our app components.

These are our main diagrams, which we think gives a good sense of detail but if you need anything else, please do contact us.
### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

NEFTME proposes to develop a differentiating and disruptive product on a global scale, where users can truly monetize through their own content. The NEFTME team has analyzed the market trends and feels that this is the moment to build a product like the one we are developing and which we believe will have a strong absorption in the world market.
 
Finally, the design of our marketing strategy and influential people from different markets and countries could be the key point of our success, combined with 52 actions designed to have a strong impact on our product, in all of us. Would be an honor for us to do all this with Polkadot´s stamp and support on our backs!


- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

We´ve started this company because we want to make the first social network that really aggregate value to the community!

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

NO

  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?


  NEFTME stands side by side with web3 NFTs marketplaces startups like Opensea, Only1 or Coinbase NFT, and we aspire to be an alternative to web2 social networks like Instagram or TikTok!
 
How NEFTME differs from other web3 NFTs Marketplaces players:
 
- NEFTME really focuses on giving value to the community through content monetization.
- We want people to contribute to a better society so when someone creates an NFT, has to choose how much % of future sales goes to the owner vs its community/supporters (stakers). Giving space for philanthropic initiatives.
 
Four things NEFTME can do, that web2 social networks can't:
- Ownership of data, access, and content.
- Content monetization.
- Benefit from the network value created through engagement and connections, powered by "followers/supporters" commitment.
- Users are co-owners of the network.
